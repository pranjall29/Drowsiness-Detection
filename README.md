# Drowsiness-Detection

Majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. This project focuses on building a system with the help of python, open CV and Keras to alert the driver when he or she is feeling drowsy.
The system will detect the personâ€™s eyes and identify if they are closed or open. If they are closed for a time greater than the threshold, the driver is alerted by the sound of an alarm.
